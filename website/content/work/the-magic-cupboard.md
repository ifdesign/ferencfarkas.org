## About the work

The comic opera entitled “The Magic Cupboard” meant a turning-point in the career of Ferenc Farkas who was ranked among the most remarkable Hungarian composers of the time after the work's highly acclaimed premiere in 1942.

Ever since his years of study at the Academy of Music (1923-27) Farkas had in mind to set to music one of the tales of “The Arabian Nights”: “What especially interested me as musican already at that time was an empty stage with a quartet in a cupboard…! So Farkas started his composition, but he soon abandoned his writing because the libretto was unsuitable for him. Only the overture was performed- with the title “Introductory Music to a Comedy” - at a concert in the Redoute of Pest in the spring of 1928.

In the mid-thirties Farkas got down to work on “The Magic Cupboard” again, but was not more inspired by Zàltan Vàrkonyi's poems. He finally found in the person of Gyula Kunszery the proper librettist in 1938 and worked on the opera during four years, mainly in the summer months. The extremely witty, funny text, ornate with smoothly-running verses lent wings to the composer who, furthermore, had already gathered abundant experiences with stage by then. The creation of the opera took place at the Königlischen Openhaus in Budapest. It was also performed in Kolozsvàr and Erfurt (1943), followed by performances in Plauen (1952), Gera (1953).

But these presentations had however demonstrated that the German translation presented major weaknesses. After many experiences a translator of high level had been found in the person of Karlheinz Gutheim, who completely altered the text. The opera was presented in this new version in Luzern (1964), Oberhausen (1966), Berlin and Szeged (1970), Bautzen (1974).

In 1984, the "International Opernstudio" Zurich let know its intention of playing "The Magic Cupboard" but with a smaller orchestra. « …I was a little anxious about this application. This meant that I had to transform a Palace in a bungalow with the same comfort. But this challenge interested me and the original symphony orchestra was reduced to an ensemble of 13 musicians - 4 wood, 4 brass musicians and a string quintet… ».

In 1975, the Hungarian Television broadcasted a version of the work in one act signed by the director-playwright Sàndor Ruitner.

Thank to easily singable natural melodies and ingenious musical and stage solutions “The Magic Cupboard” already won the audience during its first performance. The fact that Farkas’s music is at the same time traditional and modern gives a particular attraction to the piece. Listeners perceive at first the basic musical layer of the work: the tonality running through the entire piece and the well-know turns of the c1assical composers, while the modern harmonies, the intricate rhythm and the subtle discordance - elements of Farkas's idiosyncratic style - are felt as means of expression and a kind of spice to the tone. The eastern coloration deriving from the story appears in Farkas's music to a lesser degree only: the composer wished to retain his Hungarian musical idiom. Eastern-sounding melodic turns emerge mostly in the Mufti's song which underlines at the same time his cunning character. The orchestration reminding of operatic janissary music occurs in the chorus of the Master joiner's apprentices. The lucidity of the large form is achieved by means of a witty solution: before each scene Farkas lets a female trio (three odalisques) tell and comment the plot in the manner of a ritornello. In the longer scenes the parts - arias and ensembles - do not interrupt the f1ow of events: the sections follow almost without a break, providing little opportunity for meditation. At the level of music and drama, the opera can be compared to an immense crescendo in which music gains more and more place: there are more and more persons on stage who sing melodies of increasing dimensions. After the initial short ariosos, ariettas and duets the first act concludes with a two-part chorus, then in the second act the duet of Suleika and the Cadi is followed by a trio constructed of larger units (Suleika-Mufti-Grand Vizier). The Quartet of the suitors in the cupboard represents the musical culmination of the work where the flow of events halts for the first time in the opera. To their desperate complaints answers back a still larger ensemble, the neighbours' four-part chorus. At the end all actors appear on stage in agreement with comic operatic traditions and proclaim together the lesson from the story.

Farkas says about his opera : “I wanted to create an easily accessible and fun work. I think that an opera should be understood easily and immediately. Where so many elements are concentrated, words, action, decoration, light effects etc. the music can not be too difficult. Mozart has not composed for the stage like for his symphonies and his string quartets. This is not a miracle that the operas of Verdi and Puccini - despite periods of adequacy and snobbery - are still the most popular works in the repertoire.  In my opera, there are no experiments, no big problems, and if the public enjoyed and did not regretted the one hour and a half, so my objective  is reached”.
