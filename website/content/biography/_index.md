### by András Farkas

{{% row %}}
{{% column size="2" %}}
Ferenc Farkas was born on december 15th 1905 in Nagykanisza, a small village
in north-west of Hungary.

His life covers almost a whole century during which he lived 2 world wars,
2 revolutions, the fascism, the communism and finally, in 1989, the long
awaited establishment of a free and sovereign Hungary. He died in Budapest on
october 10th 2000, aged 95.

His [huge work (about 800 titles)]({{< ref "/work" >}}) has played a
determining role in the evolution of hungarian music of the 20th century.
He was one of the most eminent musicians of the so-called “middle generation”.
The preceding generation was the one of Bartók and Kodály, whose researches
contributed to a true renaissance of hungarian music.

Ferenc Farkas studied composition in Budapest with
[Albert Siklós](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Sikl%C3%B3s) and
[Leo Weiner](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Leó_Weiner).
After working some time as a "repetiteur", he went to Rome in 1929 where the
benefit of a scholarship allowed him to study with
[Ottorino Respighi](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottorino_Respighi).

That was the time when he discovered his true artistic identity. Respighi
introduced him to different forms and styles of Italian music. He also
transmitted to him his virtuosity in the art of instrumentation, his taste
for orchestral colours, his passion of ancient music and his vision for
the modern art.

In Rome, Farkas became familiar with latin and mediterranean cultures,
including painting and poetry amongst other types of expression in which he
always showed interest since he was child.

After two years of studies, he went back to Budapest.

> When I returned from Rome, I thought the world is mine but soon I understood
that I will not succeed to find a stable job.

As the Great Depression was being felt heavily in Hungary, Farkas only found
odd jobs like theatre co-repetiteur, choirmaster and music teacher.

A meeting with [Pal Fejős](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Fejos), a
world-renowned hungarian film director, in 1933 was key in his musical career.
Respighi was Fejős's favorite composer, so knowing
Farkas was one of his student, he gave him his chance in one of his film.

During their collaboration, Farkas composed the music of 6 movies and 25
short films on Madagascar. He took advantage of this situation to travel and
discover Europe and its cultures: for shooting interests he spent 2 years in
Vienna, 2 years in Copenhagen and cruised around the Mediterranean during the
winter of 1933-34.

He continued to compose film music (a total of 75) until 1973.

Ferenc Farkas returned in Hungary in 1936. His first real public success
happened in 1937 with his “Concerto for harp”. It is also the time of his first stage music and radio works, on texts by Hungarian authors like “The tragedy of man” by Imre Madách in 1937, but also Shakespeare, Calderón, Moliere, Rostand, Aristophanes, Goethe, Lope de Vega. In all some 40 works which offer Farkas an unlimited field for experimentations and a source of endless inspiration. He will often use them to compose other works.

In 1939, when the war broke out, Hungary, allied with Germany, had not yet
entered the conflict but it recovered part of the territories it had lost at
the end of the First World War.

> In 1941, Viktor Vaszy invited me to become a composition teacher at the
Conservatory in Cluj - the capital of Transylvania, which returned to Hungary -
and to conduct the Choir of the National Theatre. For me, this meant an official
state position and a substantial increase in my financial income.
I was more than 45 years old and I finally obtained a full time job.

The first opera of Farkas, “The magic cupboard”, which dates from that time, brings my father national celebrity and fame across borders.
