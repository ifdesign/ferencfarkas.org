{{% column size="2" %}}
Ferenc Farkas was born on december 15th 1905 in Nagykanisza, a small village in north-west of Hungary.

His life covers almost a whole century during which he lived 2 world wars, 2 revolutions, the fascism, the communism and finally, in 1989, the long awaited establishment of a free and sovereign Hungary. He died in Budapest, October 10, 2000, in his 95th year.

His [huge work (about 800 titles)]({{< ref "/work" >}}) has played a determining role in the evolution of Hungarian music of the 20th century. He was one of the most eminent musicians of the so-called “middle generation”. The generation before, was the one of Bartók and Kodály whose researches contributed to a veritable renaissance of Hungarian music.

Ferenc Farkas studied composition at Budapest, with Albert Siklós and Leo Weiner. After working for a while as repetiteur, he went to Rome in 1929, where the benefit of a scholarship permitted him to study with Ottorino Respighi. He will discover there his veritable identity. Respighi initiates him in different forms and styles of Italian music. He also transmits him his extraordinary virtuosity in art of instrumentation, his taste for orchestral colours, his love for ancient music, and his vision about modern art. In Rome, Farkas will become familiar with Latin and Mediterranean culture, painting, poetry and all types of expression for which he was already interested since his childhood.
