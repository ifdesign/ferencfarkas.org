Ferenc Farkas was born on december 15th 1905 in Nagykanisza, a small village
in north-west of Hungary.

His life covers almost a whole century during which he lived 2 world wars,
2 revolutions, the fascism, the communism and finally, in 1989, the long
awaited establishment of a free and sovereign Hungary. He died in Budapest on
october 10th 2000, aged 95.

His [huge work (about 800 titles)]({{< ref "/work" >}}) has played a
determining role in the evolution of Hungarian music of the 20th century.
He was one of the most eminent musicians of the so-called “middle generation”.
The preceding generation was the one of Bartók and Kodály, whose researches
contributed to a true renaissance of hungarian music.

Ferenc Farkas studied composition in Budapest with Albert Siklós and Leo Weiner.
After working some time as a "repetiteur", he went to Rome in 1929 where the
benefit of a scholarship allowed him to study with Ottorino Respighi.

That wa sthe time whe he discovered his true artistic identity. Respighi
introduced him to different forms and styles of Italian music. He also
transmitted to him his virtuosity in the art of instrumentation, his taste
for orchestral colours, his passion of ancient music and his vision for
the modern art.

In Rome, Ferenc Farkas became familiar with latin and mediterranean cultures,
including painting and poetry amongst other types of expression in which he
always showed interest since he was child.

> When I returned from Rome, I thought the world is mine but soon I understood
that I will not succeed to find a stable job.
