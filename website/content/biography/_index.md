{{% column size="2" %}}
Ferenc Farkas was born on december 15th 1905 in Nagykanisza, a small village
in north-west of Hungary.

His life covers almost a whole century during which he lived 2 world wars,
2 revolutions, the fascism, the communism and finally, in 1989, the long
awaited establishment of a free and sovereign Hungary. He died in Budapest on
october 10th 2000, aged 95.

His [huge work (about 800 titles)]({{< ref "/work" >}}) has played a
determining role in the evolution of Hungarian music of the 20th century.
He was one of the most eminent musicians of the so-called “middle generation”.
The preceding generation was the one of Bartók and Kodály, whose researches
contributed to a true renaissance of hungarian music.

Ferenc Farkas studied composition in Budapest with Albert Siklós and Leo Weiner.
After working some time as a "repetiteur", he went to Rome in 1929 where the
benefit of a scholarship allowed him to study with Ottorino Respighi.

That was the time whe he discovered his true artistic identity. Respighi
introduced him to different forms and styles of Italian music. He also
transmitted to him his virtuosity in the art of instrumentation, his taste
for orchestral colours, his passion of ancient music and his vision for
the modern art.

In Rome, Ferenc Farkas became familiar with latin and mediterranean cultures,
including painting and poetry amongst other types of expression in which he
always showed interest since he was child.

> When I returned from Rome, I thought the world is mine but soon I understood
that I will not succeed to find a stable job.

_In 1931 the Great Depression was being felt heavily in Hungary._

_Going back to Rome, Farkas found only odd jobs like theatre co-repetiteur,
choirmaster and music teacher._ Vraiment utile cette info ?

The meeting with the Hungarian director Pal Fejős, in 1933, gave my father the possibility of having his first experiences in the new aria of filmmaking. For Fejős he composes music for 6 films and 25 scores for short movies about Madagascar. With him, my father discovers other places and cultures: for shooting interests he passes 2 years in Vienna, 2 years in Copenhagen and he makes a long journey around Mediterranean Sea. Other film scores - 75 in total - with other directors, will follow till 1973.
