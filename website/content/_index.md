## Welcome!

This is the official website of Hungarian composer **Ferenc Farkas** (1905 - 2000).

It is maintained by his son, Andras Farkas and his family and aims to provide
as much content as possible about the work and life of Ferenc Farkas.

Content is still under development and will be regularly added.

We currently focus on fullfiling the [catalogue of works](/work) which contains
more than 800 works. We've planned to add musical samples, images and contextual
information for the most famous and played works.
