## Welcome!

This is the official website of Hungarian composer **Ferenc Farkas** (1905 - 2000).

It is maintained by his son, **Andras Farkas** and his family and aims to provide
as much content as possible about the work and life of Ferenc Farkas.

**Content is under active development and will be regularly added.**

<!--
We currently focus on fullfiling the [catalogue of works](/work) which contains
more than 800 works. We've planned to add musical samples, images and contextual
information for the most famous and played works.
