# The ferencfarkas.org project

The **ferencfarkas.org** project aims to promote the work of hungarian classical music composer **Ferenc Farkas** (1905 - 2000).

It first started in 1992 when Ferenc's son and his wife started to draw up an inventory of every work Farkas composed during his life. They managed to publish and maintain a catalogue of more than 800 items described and categorized so that musicians and other music professionals could get to know his work better.

After Farkas's death in 2000, son Andras and his wife Fran√ßoise dedicated a part of their free time to collect material to relate Farkas's life and work and initiated many promotional projects: concerts, conferences, musical events, recording sessions, publishing of manuscripts, etc.
