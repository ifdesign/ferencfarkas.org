# The ferencfarkas.org project

The **ferencfarkas.org** project aims to promote the work of hungarian classical music composer **Ferenc Farkas** (1905 - 2000).

## Goals of the project

The **ferencfarkas.org** project is a website with 3 main goals in mind:

 - Provide as many detailed informations and material as possible about Ferenc Farkas to the public.
 - Help people know and listen to Farkas's music.
 - Connect with other people to promote Farkas's work as much as possible.
 

### History

It first started in 1992 when Ferenc's son and his wife started to draw up an inventory of every work Farkas composed during his life. They managed to publish and maintain a catalogue of more than 800 items described and categorized so that musicians and other music professionals could get to know his work better.

After Farkas's death in 2000, son **Andras** and his wife **Françoise** dedicated a part of their free time to collect material to relate Farkas's life and work and initiated many promotional projects: concerts, conferences, musical events, recording sessions, publishing of manuscripts, etc.

As a natural consequence, grandkids also took part in the project and added their stone to the building by putting their parents' immense work to the digital world.
